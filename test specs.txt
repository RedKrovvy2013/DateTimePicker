<date-picker sb-before-render-item=“beforeRenderDateItem”><date-picker/>

In the controller I define the logic for beforeRenderDateItem:

function beforeRenderDateItem(day) {
  day.disabled = day.date.getDay() > 3;
}

The "day.disabled = day.date.getDay() > 3;” is part of business logic. It definitely does not belong to the date time picker directive.

I should be able to disable/enable date and time options based on a complex business logic of the application, without updating a single line of the date/time picker directive.

Implement a “Date and Time picker” directive with a timezone support using AngularJS. You may use any 3rd party libraries (Moment.js for example). The directive should consist of 2 sub-directives: Date input and Time input. Both inputs should be binded to the single model property. Time selector should be disabled if Date is not chosen.

Both sub-directives should accept OPTIONAL “sb-before-render-item” function. This function accepts date/time object, which has “disabled” attribute. Function may update that attribute (true/false) to disable/enable the date or time.

More info:
“ng-model” value should be updated only when both Date and Time chosen.
If both Date and Time selected, and then user updates date to a value which invalidates selected time, the selected time should be unset, and ng-model should be updated to null. For example: working hours for weekdays are 7AM-8PM, and for weekends - 10AM-4PM. If user select Friday 8AM, and then updates Day to Sunday, previously selected time should become unset.
sbTimeZone should be one way binded. When time zone changes, the selected time and date should persist to what they were before. For example if currently selected Date/Time is 10/26/2016 10:15AM PDT and time zone is changed to “America/New_York” (EST), the new selected date/time should be 10/26/2016 10:15AM EST.
Date/Time select may be initialized with ng-model=null as well as already predefined date/time. If date/time predefined, it should be rendered within time zone according to sbTimeZone attribute, and date in calendar as well as time in time slots view should be selected/activated.

Markup example:

JS:
order = {
  requestedDatetime: null,
  timeZone: ‘America/Los_Angeles'
}

HTML:
<date-time-picker ng-model=“order.requestedDatetime” sb-time-zone=“order.timeZone” required=“true”>
  <date-picker sb-before-render-item=“beforeRenderDateItem”><date-picker/>
  <time-picker sb-before-render-item=“beforeRenderTimeItem”><time-picker/>
</date-time-picker>
